## Notes

Poolish is one of the three preferments I'm familiar with (the others are the biga and sponge). Still experimenting, and slightly skeptical of the effect.

## Instructions

- Mix up everything in a bowl
- Leave it out to sit for 4-8 hours, you'll know its ready because it will have full puffed up and smell really fragrant.
- Toss it in with the rest of your ingredients. [See the poolish dough for an example.](/recipes/poolish-dough)
