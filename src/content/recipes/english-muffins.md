## Notes

- Leave the dough in the fridge overnight for better flavour
- Use the paddle not dough hook, mix till it starts to pull away from the side of the bowl
- 1.5x these for two oven fulls

## Instructions

- Combine the milk, water, and sugar in a bowl or glass measuring cup then stir together and warm in the microwave to 110F add the yeast and stir once more. Set aside for 5-7 minutes or until a foamy head develops.
- While the yeast wakes up combine the flour and salt in the bowl of your mixer and whisk together then fit with a paddle attachment.
- Mix the egg and melted butter into the milk mixture then slowly pour the liquid into your flour mixture while mixing on low. Increase the speed to medium high and mix for about 7 minutes or until the dough is elastic and smooth.
- Transfer to a large oiled bowl and cover with plastic. Allow to double in size in a warm spot (about an hour). You can also refrigerate the dough overnight, in which case you'll let it warm for an hour when ready to use.
- Transfer the dough to a floured counter then gently spread out and pat down until it's just under an inch thick. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle with cornmeal or semolina.
- Use a 3 inch round cutter to cut your muffins then gently transfer them to the prepared baking sheets using a spatula or your hands. Re-roll the scraps and continue cutting until the dough is used up. Cover loosely with plastic and place in a warm spot to rise for about 30 minutes.
- Place a large skillet over very low heat. Once you can feel the heat when placing your hand a few inches over the surface sprinkle the surface with cornmeal or semolina then carefully place 3-4 muffins on the pan. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook for another 5-6 minutes.
- Clear the old cornmeal off the pan then add a fresh sprinkle and cook the remaining muffins. Enjoy warm! If you haven't made these before it's best to cook a test muffin to get the feel of it.
