## Instructions

- In a 2 cup measuring cup or bowl, combine 1 cup warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes until frothy.
- In a large bowl, blend 3 cups warm water (or partial milk), sugar, melted lard or canola oil, salt, vinegar, and eggs.
- After 10 minutes, mix the yeast mixture into the wet ingredients.
- Start adding flour about 1 cup at a time until you cannot stir anymore.
- Begin kneading by hand, adding flour as needed until you have a smooth ball of dough that is not sticking to the bowl or counter.
- Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1.5 hours.
- Punch down dough and let rise again until doubled, which takes less time.
- Form into buns, pizza bases, or bread.
- The recipe makes roughly 4 dozen buns or 4 loaves of bread.
- Bake buns at 400°F (205°C) for 15-20 minutes.
- Bake bread for 25-30 minutes at 385°F (195°C).
- Bake pizzas at 450-500°F (230-260°C) for about 12 minutes.
