## Notes

- I got real liberal with it though, just grabbed all the stuff from the store and tossed pretty much everything I had in the blender. Turned out pretty nice by eye and would probably be nice to have a difference every time.

## Instructions

- Slam all the fresh aromatics in the blender and grind it down to a fine paste. Use a bit of oil if there's not enough liquid at first.
- Cook your protein in some oil, coconut oil is great for the flavour
- Remove meat and spoon in 2-3 healthy scoops of green curry paste
- Cook it down a bit, add a little bit of coconut milk
- Add the rest of coconut milk, season, add sweetener
- Add veggies and chicken back in
- Let it simmer for a while till tasty
