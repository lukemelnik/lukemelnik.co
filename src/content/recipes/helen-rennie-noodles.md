## Notes

She recommends 00 flour originally, but bread flour is fine. This recipe uses a ridiculous amount of eggs and turns out quite dry but that makes the rolling so much nicer.

On that note, when kneading don't try to do to much at once. You can just fold an edge over and work it in. And don't be afraid of the salt, it looks like lot but it's just right.

Use rice flour to keep the noodles from sticking together after cutting. 

For freezing, twist up and put on a tray then freeze for an hour. Then transfer to a bag. 

## Instructions

- Add enough water to eggs and yolks to reach 370g total weight (I or just use some of the egg whites)
- Give the dry ingredients a quick mix, then add the wet. She uses a food processor but I've had good luck with the mixer. It's hard on the machine though so just get it mixed together then knead.
- Knead by hand for 12 minutes. Toss it in a container and let it rest for a bit.
- Roll it and cut it.
