## Notes

Makes about 8 solid sized pizzas, OR if you're feeling saucy do 4 pizzas and spread the rest out into a flat rectangle and make cinnamon buns.

## Instructions

- Mix the poolish up and leave it on the counter for 6-8h
- Throw everything in the mixer (used to have fancy method of slowly adding water but turns out great without it)
- Mix for quite a while, more than ten min prob but most important is that it starts to pull away from the bowl. That means the gluten is developed
- Can just leave to sit in mixer bowl for rise. Cover with a plate or whatever. Extra fast if you turn oven on for a couple min and put it in there. One rise is fine
- Heavy flour on counter, solid dusting on top of the dough when you scrape it out of the bowl
- Cut it up into portions, shape into balls and let it sit again
- Can put in the fridge for a long time and keeps fine
