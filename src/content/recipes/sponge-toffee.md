## Instructions

- Cook sugar, dark corn syrup, and vinegar over medium heat in a large heavy-based pot, stirring frequently, until the mixture puffs up.
- Using a candy thermometer, cook until the temperature reaches 300Â°F (hard "brittle" stage).
- Quickly stir in baking soda.
- Pour the mixture into a well-buttered or parchment paper-lined 9 x 9 x 2 inch cake pan.
- Do not move the pan while the toffee cools, or it will fall.
- When cool, optionally paint with melted chocolate.
- Break into pieces with a hammer and store in a dry container.
