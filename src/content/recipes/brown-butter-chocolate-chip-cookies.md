## Instructions

- Cook the butter. I've tried fast & slow, there's no difference. Best way was in a pot on fairly high heat, stirring frequently. When it get's really bubbly it's done.
- Cool the browned butter down in the fridge or freezer.
- Add everything except for the flour & chocolate chips and mix
- Add the flour and mix
- Add the chocolate chips and mix briefly
- If you're feeling patient you can let the dough sit overnight. Still good if you want to just cook right away.
- Preheat to 350
- Cook until they just start to brown (10-12ish minutes). They won't look cooked but they're done! (Although if you want to make ice cream sandwiches you can slightly overcook for a nice crunch)
- Cool them off on a rack
