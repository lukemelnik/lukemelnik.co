## Notes

Dough weight: 1500g (2 750g loaves)

## Instructions

- Mix up with scraper, folding dry into the centre till moisture fairly well distributed & no flour on the bottom
- Let it sit, 4-5 stretch and pulls, interval doesn't seem to matter
- After that I just let it sit out till it's fully risen, usually takes up the whole bowl. Depending when it might sit out all night
- LOTS of flour on counter to avoid stick, dump out and dust the top heavily
- Slice in half, stretch each very roughly into a rectangle shape, fold both long ends into centre, then spin and roll up the opposite way, stitching the ends
- Typical rice flour sprinkle
- Flop into basket, then it sits out with the canvas on top til it's fully risen again, usually poppin' a half inch out of the basket or so
- Boil some water, pan at the bottom of oven at 450F
- Plop 'em on the steel, give 'em a slice, a cup or so of boiling water in the pan
- Cook till you like the crust.
