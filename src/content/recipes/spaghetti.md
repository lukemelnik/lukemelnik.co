## Notes

- Works great to cook the noodles right in pot, but does have a different texture. If you cook the noodles separately you might not need the added water, depending on how saucy you like it.

## Instructions

- Brown up the meat and break it down into small chunks
- Toss in onion, garlic and some salt. Cook it down a bit. Note: he makes a great point about adding salt in multiple stages to make sure all parts of a dish taste seasoned
- Add spices and tomato paste
- Add beef bouillon
- Add crushed tomatoes & extra water (amount depends on whether you're cooking dry spaghetti)
- Add fresh basil
- If cooking from dry break the pasta up and add it. For fresh noodles just cook the pasta and pour it over them.
- He puts it in the oven to finish, I've had great results just finishing on the stove with the dutch oven.
